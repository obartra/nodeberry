# Captain's Log

We'll build a program that follows the following structure:

- wake word "Captains Log stardate XYZ"
- "Enter verification codes"
- check passwords
- if incorrect -> unauthorized message
- if correct -> start transmission
- listen for "pause log" when recording
- listen for "resume log" when paused
- listen for "end transmission"
