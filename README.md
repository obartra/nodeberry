# üçì nodeberry

This project contains a series of Node-based tutorials to build automation projects. It's based on the [ZeldaHomeAutomation](https://github.com/Sufficiently-Advanced/ZeldaHomeAutomation) project but written entirely in JavaScript and with step-by-step instructions.

You can get a sense for what it will look like once completed based on this video although the projects here aren't exactly the same:
