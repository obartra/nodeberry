# üçì nodeberry

This project contains a series of Node-based tutorials to build automation projects. It's based on the [ZeldaHomeAutomation](https://github.com/Sufficiently-Advanced/ZeldaHomeAutomation) project but written entirely in JavaScript and with step-by-step instructions.

The goal is to showcase how to understand speech and generate speech, integrate with IFTTT, and connect to raspberry Pi and espruino devices to spark ideas for automation projects.

You can get a sense for what it will look like once completed based on this video although the projects here aren't exactly the same:

## üóÑÔ∏èProjects
